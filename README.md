# Make-Val-VSS-great-again-SPT-Mod

Fed up with VAL and VSS being useless? This mod is for you!

In patch 0.13, BSG increased the heating of the VSS and Val, making it impossible to use these weapons. This mod changes the `HeatFactorGun` and `HeatFactorByShot` values for VSS and Val, and also reduces the `HeatFactor` values for bullets such as SP-5, SP-6, PAB-9, and SPP. Now your weapon will not overheat after one 30-round magazine.

> **NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE REALISM MOD!**

I don't know the exact cause, but my mod, with literally the few simplest functions, causes weapons to constantly overheat when used with the Realism mod. Most likely, it's the Realism mod itself and its overheating weapon rework. You can try disabling this feature in the Realism mod or try loading my mod after Realism. To do this, you can add some `z`s to the folder name, for example, `zzHacker228-MakeVSSGreatAgain-1.0.4`.

## Installation:

Move the `Hacker228-MakeVSSGreatAgain` folder to `[SPT_folder]/user/mods`.
